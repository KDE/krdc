Qt-only version of the KRDC VNC backend
=======================================

In order to build it, you need the LibVNCClient (LibVNCServer)
library (version 0.9.1 or newer required):
  http://sourceforge.net/project/showfiles.php?group_id=32584&package_id=24717

To build, run
  cmake
  make

Note that the source directory MUST be under krdc/vnc, as files from krdc/vnc
and krdc/core are used (in particular krdc/vnc/vncview.{cpp,h},
krdc/vnc/vncclientthread.{cpp,h}, and krdc/core/remoteview.{cpp,h}).

In order to try it out, type:
  ./krdc-vnc-qtonly vnc://:password@server:1 1
  (the last argument defines the quality as second argument (1-3, where 1 is
  the best). Default is 2.)

If you use these code in your project, make sure that QTONLY is defined (see
krdc-vnc-qtonly.pro).
