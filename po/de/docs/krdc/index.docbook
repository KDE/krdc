<title>Introduction</title>

<para>
&krdc; is a client application that allows you to view or even control
the desktop session on another machine that is running a compatible
server.
</para>

<para>
You would typically use &krdc; with the &kde; <acronym>VNC</acronym> server (&krfb;), which is
also known as Krfb, since it closely matches the special features of &krdc;.
</para>

<para>
If you want to start &krdc; from &konsole;, the command is <userinput><command>krdc</command></userinput>.

<chapter id="what-is-RFB">
<title>The Remote Frame Buffer protocol</title>

<para>
This chapter provides a brief description of the Remote Frame Buffer
protocol used by &krdc; and by other compatible systems. If you are
already familiar with Remote Frame Buffer, you can safely skip this
chapter.
</para>

<para>
The high level implementation of a system using the Remote Frame
Buffer protocol is known as Virtual Network Computer, or more often
just as <acronym>VNC</acronym>.
</para>

<para>
Remote Frame Buffer (or <acronym>RFB</acronym> for short) is a simple
protocol for remote access to graphical user interfaces. It works at
the frame-buffer level, which roughly corresponds to the rendered
screen image, which means that it can be applied to all windowing
systems (including X11, &MacOS; and &Microsoft; &Windows;). Remote
Frame Buffer applications exist for many platforms, and can often be
free re-distributed.
</para>

<para>
In the Remote Frame Buffer protocol, the application that runs on the
machine where the user sits (containing the display, keyboard and
pointer) is called the client. The application that runs on the
machine where the framebuffer is located (which is running the
windowing system and applications that the user is remotely
controlling) is called the server. &krdc; is the &kde; client for the
Remote Frame Buffer protocol. &krfb; is the &kde; server for the
Remote Frame Buffer protocol. 
</para>

<para>
It takes a reasonable amount of network traffic to send an image of
the framebuffer, so Remote Frame Buffer works best over high
bandwidth links, such as a local area network. It is still possible to
use &krdc; over other links, but performance is unlikely to be as good.
</para>

<title>Using &krdc;</title>

<para>
It is very easy to use &krdc; - it has a simple interface, as shown in
the screenshot below.
</para>

<para>

</para>

<sect1 id="compatible-versions"><title>Connecting &krdc; to compatible servers</title>

<para>
&krdc; is a client, and it needs to be used with compatible
servers. There are different ways to connect to those servers:
</para>

<itemizedlist>
<listitem>
<para>Directly typing the server name (or IP address) into the
<guilabel>Connect to:</guilabel> input.</para> 
</listitem>
<listitem>
<para>By using an invitation that you received. &krfb; uses
invitations, and can send them by email.</para>
</listitem>
</itemizedlist>

<para>
Let's look at each of these in turn.
</para>

<sect2><title>Server name entry</title>
<para>
If you know the host name (or IP address) of the server you want to
connect to, you can enter it directly into the <guilabel>Connect to:</guilabel> input.
</para>

<para>
If you want to connect to a machine named megan, which is
running a <acronym>VNC</acronym> server on screen 1 (5901), you can enter
<userinput>megan:1</userinput> or <userinput>megan:5901</userinput> and 
choose <guilabel>vnc</guilabel> as the protocol in the 
drop down box.
</para>
<para>

	  <textobject>
	    <phrase>Entering a hostname into &krdc;</phrase>
	  </textobject>
	</mediaobject>
</screenshot>
</para>

<para>
Similary, if you are using a <acronym>RDP</acronym> server on that
machine, you can enter <userinput>megan</userinput>. Choose <guilabel>rdp</guilabel> as
the protocol. <acronym>RDP</acronym> does not need the screen number to be specified.
If the server runs the <acronym>RDP</acronym> server not on the default port, you may
specify it in the following way: <userinput>megan:3910</userinput>
</para>
<para>You need to enter an &URL; in percent encoded syntax, i.e. @ as %40, for &eg; 
<userinput>username%40ad.domain.example</userinput>
</para>
<!--https://bugs.kde.org/show_bug.cgi?id=261076-->

</sect2>

<sect2><title>Using an invitation</title>
<para>
Within the &krfb; server application, it is possible to send
invitations over email (and in other ways, although email is the most
useful). If you receive this type of email invitation, you can just
click on the link provided in the mail.
This will start &krdc; if it is not already running, and connect to
the server specified in the invitation.
</para>

</sect2>

</sect1>

<sect1 id="connection"><title>What happens when you connect</title>

<para>
Notice: Before connecting, ensure that the target computer (server) is
available on the network and, if necessary, that its firewall has
been correctly configured or disabled.
</para>

<para>
No matter how you select the server to connect to, the next thing that
happens is that &krdc; asks you about the network connection to the
server, as shown below:
</para>

<para>
<screenshot>
<screeninfo>&krdc; connection speed selection</screeninfo>
	<mediaobject>
	  <imageobject>
	    <imagedata fileref="vnc_host_configuration.png" format="PNG"/>
	  </imageobject>
	  <textobject>
	    <phrase>&krdc; connection speed selection</phrase>
	  </textobject>
	</mediaobject>
</screenshot>
</para>

<para>
There are three speed settings for the <acronym>VNC</acronym> protocol:
</para>

<itemizedlist>
<listitem><para>High Quality (LAN, direct connection), which is the
default, and you should evaluate how well this setting performs before
selecting a lower performance option that uses less bandwidth.
</para></listitem>
<listitem><para>Medium Quality (DSL, Cable, fast
Internet).</para></listitem>
<listitem><para>Low Quality (Modem, ISDN, slow
Internet).</para></listitem>
</itemizedlist>

<para>
If you always operate over the same link type, you can deselect the
checkbox labeled <guilabel>Show this dialog again for this
host</guilabel>, which means that you won't be asked about the
connection type again for this host, providing you identify it in the
same way. For example, if a host has two names, and deselect the
checkbox when connecting using one name, you won't get asked if you
connect using that name, although you will be asked if you use the
other name, or the IP address.
</para>

<para>
You select the appropriate speed setting, and select the
<guibutton>OK</guibutton> to proceed.
</para>

<para>
You can see the connection status in the icon in the tab.
</para>

<para>
Depending on the configuration of the server, you may (and almost
certainly will) need to provide a password to authenticate to the
server. &krdc; will provide a password dialog similar to that shown
below.
</para>

<para>
&krdc; has the ability to save the password for further connections
to the same host. It uses KWallet for doing this. You need to check the
<guibutton>Remember password (KWallet)</guibutton> check box if you like
to use this feature.
</para>

<para>
<screenshot>
<screeninfo>&krdc; password entry</screeninfo>

	  <textobject>
	    <phrase>&krdc; password entry</phrase>
	  </textobject>
	</mediaobject>
</screenshot>
</para>

<para>
After authentication, you will be connected to the remote server, and
can begin using &krdc; to observe or control the remote desktop.
</para>

</sect1>

<sect1 id="controlling-remote"><title>Controlling the remote desktop connection</title>

<para>
Having connected to the remote server, you would normally use the
keyboard and mouse to control the windowing system and applications on
that remote machine.
</para>

<para>
You can view the remote desktop either as a full screen, or as a
window on the local desktop. You can change between these modes using
icons shown below.
</para>

<para>
<screenshot>
<screeninfo>&krdc; full screen mode selection</screeninfo>
	<mediaobject>
	  <imageobject>
	    <imagedata fileref="view-fullscreen.png" format="PNG"/>
	  </imageobject>
	  <textobject>
	    <phrase>&krdc; full screen mode selection</phrase>
	  </textobject>

</para>

<para>
<screenshot>
<screeninfo>&krdc; window mode selection</screeninfo>
	<mediaobject>
	  <imageobject>
	    <imagedata fileref="view-restore.png" format="PNG"/>
	  </imageobject>
	  <textobject>
	    <phrase>&krdc; window mode selection</phrase>
	  </textobject>
	</mediaobject>
</screenshot>
</para>

<para>
Full screen mode is normally better when you are helping a remote
user, because you can see all of what they can see. Window mode is
most useful when you are working both remotely and locally - perhaps
referring to some local documentation and then using those
instructions on the remote machine.
</para>

<sect2><title>Using window mode</title>

<para>
In window mode, you can terminate the connection by closing the window, by clicking
on the logout button.
</para>

</sect2>

<sect2><title>Using full screen mode</title>

<para>
In full screen mode, you can change the appearance of the toolbar.
The transparency of the toolbar can be changed with scrollwheel.
</para>

</sect2>

</sect1>

<sect1 id="bookmarks"><title>Bookmarks</title>

<para>
&krdc; has the ability to manage bookmarks. If you need to connect often to
the same remote desktop, you can add an entry for this connection to the
bookmark list. You can do so with a click on <menuchoice><guimenu>Bookmarks</guimenu>
<guimenuitem>Add Bookmark</guimenuitem></menuchoice>.
</para>

<para>
<screenshot>
<screeninfo>&krdc; bookmarks menu</screeninfo>
	<mediaobject>
	  <imageobject>
	    <imagedata fileref="bookmarks_menu.png" format="PNG"/>
	  </imageobject>
	  <textobject>
	    <phrase>&krdc; bookmarks menu</phrase>
	  </textobject>
	</mediaobject>
</screenshot>
</para>


<sect2><title>History Bookmarks</title>

<para>
&krdc; saves last used remote desktop connections. You can access these special
bookmarks at <menuchoice><guimenu>Bookmarks</guimenu><guimenuitem>History</guimenuitem></menuchoice>. Of course you can also
delete a bookmark of this list if you don't need it anymore in the list. Just click
<guibutton>Delete Bookmark</guibutton> which appears after a click with the right mouse button on
the bookmark you would like to delete.
</para>

</sect2>

</sect1>

<sect1 id="managing-configuration"><title>Managing &krdc; configuration</title>
<para>
Using <menuchoice><guimenu>Settings</guimenu><guimenuitem>Configure KRDC...</guimenuitem></menuchoice>, 
you can open a dialog to modify the behavior of &krdc;. Selecting that button brings up a
window as shown below:
</para>

<para>
<screenshot>
<screeninfo>&krdc; preferences - General tab</screeninfo>
	<mediaobject>
	  <imageobject>
	    <imagedata fileref="general_preferences.png" format="PNG"/>
